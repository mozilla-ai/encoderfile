    --- Applies a softmax across token classification logits.
    --- Each token classification is normalized independently.
    --- 
    --- Args:
    ---   arr (Tensor): A tensor of shape [batch_size, n_tokens, n_labels].
    ---                 The softmax is applied along the third axis (n_labels).
    ---
    --- Returns:
    ---   Tensor: The input tensor with softmax-normalized embeddings.
    ---@param arr Tensor
    ---@return Tensor
